I'm a Year 2 Ngee Ann Polytechnic Student pursuing the diploma of Information Technology with the aims to specialize in Software Engineering. I have worked on various projects that mostly revolve around web development with the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript. However, I do have programs that run on C# to test my programming logic and software designs. 

Some of my projects include :
